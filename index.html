A programming language is a registration for creating programs, specializing in compute or algorithm. Some authors limit programming language to those languages that can express all possible algorithms.This advantage is considered important for what configures a programming language.
A programming language is a formal language, comprising series of instructions that produce various sorts of output.Programming languages are used in computer programming as a mean to algorithms.Moreover, most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
